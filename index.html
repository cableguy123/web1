<P>A ship of the line was a type of naval warship constructed from the 17th thr
ou  gh to the mid-19th century to take part in the naval tactic known as the li
ne of battle, in which two columns of opposing warships would manoeuvre to bri
ng the greatest weight of broadside firepower to bear. Since these engagement
s were almost invariably won by the heaviest ships carrying the most powerfu
l guns, the natural progression was to build sailing vessels that were the
largest and most powerful of their time.</p>
